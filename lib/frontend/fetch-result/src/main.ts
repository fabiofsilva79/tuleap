/**
 * `getAllJSON` returns a `ResultAsync<ReadonlyArray<TypeOfArrayItem>, Fault>` with `TypeOfArrayItem` supplied as a
 * generic type. It is useful to query paginated endpoints that expect `limit` and `offset` search parameters.
 *
 * It queries the given URI with GET method once and reads the `X-PAGINATION-SIZE` header to figure out the total
 * number of elements to retrieve. Then, it queries it again (with GET method) with parallel requests until all elements
 * have been retrieved. It decodes each response into JSON and calls the `getCollectionCallback` (if supplied) for each
 * batch.
 *
 * `getCollectionCallback` is useful to handle differences in the endpoint JSON response shapes. Some endpoints will
 * return directly an array (`[item1, item2]`), which is what the default callback expects. Other endpoints will return
 * a JSON object containing an array (`{ collection: [item1, item2] }`). The callback receives the JSON payload
 * (with `TypeOfJSONPayload` type) and must convert it to an array of `TypeOfArrayItem`.
 *
 * The callback can also be used to do progressive display, where you display each batch of items as it arrives.
 *
 * `params` are added to the URI for each request. The only exception is `offset`, which is computed for each request
 * until all elements have been retrieved. If `limit` and `offset` `params` are not supplied, it defaults
 * `limit` to 100 and `offset` to 0.
 *
 * It is possible to control the number of parallel requests by providing a `max_parralel_requests` key in `options`.
 * Default value is 6 parallel requests.
 *
 * `getAllJSON` returns an `Ok` variant containing a single, flat array of `TypeOfArrayItem`.
 * If there was a problem in any of the requests (network error, remote API error, JSON parsing error), it returns
 * an `Err` variant containing a `Fault` for the first problem it encounters.
 *
 * Each type of Fault has a dedicated method to distinguish them in error-handling, please see the README for more details.
 *
 * @template TypeOfJSONPayload
 * @template TypeOfArrayItem
 * @param {string} uri The URI destination of the request. URI-encoding is handled automatically.
 * @param {GetAllOptions=} options (optional) An object with a `params` key containing a list of URI
 * search parameters. Each key-value pair will be URI-encoded and appended to `uri`.
 * `params` has two special keys: `limit` and `offset`. `limit` controls the number of items fetched at each
 * request, `offset` determines the starting point. `limit` defaults to 100, and `offset` to 0.
 * `options` also has a `getCollectionCallback` function, if supplied it allows to unwrap `TypeOfJSONPayload` into an
 * array of `TypeOfArrayItem`.
 * `options` also has a `max_parallel_requests` key, if supplied it controls the number of parallel requests in-flight
 * at the same time. Defaults to 6.
 * @returns {ResultAsync<ReadonlyArray<TypeOfArrayItem>, Fault>}
